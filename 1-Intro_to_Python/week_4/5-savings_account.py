"""Write a class named SavingsAccount, which allows an owner of an account to make deposits and withdrawals. 
These accounts also compute interest periodically (use an interest rate of 0.02). 
The account should allow the user to enter his/her name, PIN, and balance as attributes when an account is created, and it should return an account number for the user to use. 
The class should include the following functions: (createAccount, verifyInfo, getBalance, getName, getPin, deposit, withdraw, computeInterest).
When an account is created, the balance should be zero by default. When the account user wants to  access the account for withdrawal, deposit or computInterest, 
the program should check the userâ€™s information against the information in the account created.

Use import statements to create the object and call each function."""
